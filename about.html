            <p style="text-align:center;">
                I decided to research my wife, Randyll. She goes by Randi and is 30 years old. She was born in Kansas City, Missouri but spent most of her life in Omaha, Nebraska. 
                Randi finds herself engulfed in schoolwork daily, but she loves it. She is a 4th grade teacher and has taught within different public schools for 7 years to the date. 
                She aspires to one day be a college professor as she currently has her masters and is close to a year from being finished with her doctorate. 
                <br/>
                When Randi isn't doing homework or grading homework it is highly likely to find Randi playing with her two Australian cattle dogs or cooking. 
                <br/>
                She enjoys Crockpot meals as they work extremely well with her busy life, but whenever there is time available, she will prepare the family an exquisite meal. 
                <br/>
                Her favorite TV shows are The Office, Parks and Recreation, New Girl, Impractical Jokers, and The Bachelorette. 
                Randi is insanely crafty and would much rather create her own cards and décor rather than purchase them. If glitter were a color, it would be her favorite color and if not glitter than rainbows. 
                <br/>
                Randi's mornings usually consist of 2 cups of coffee before she considers herself alive. She is the oldest of all her siblings and the first one married. Randi is a Creighton and UNO alum. 
                Before teaching, she tried her hand at nursing but thought it was over challenging and lost interest quickly. As she began to shadow her past teachers she then fell in love with teaching.
